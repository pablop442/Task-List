# Task List

## Why again?
So I am revisiting some old projects I made during my Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp.

By the end of last year (2021) I was learning React from scratch and I was very lost (still am a little bit haha), so I decided to read and study more to improve my React skills.

This project is a better version of my last to-do list with some cool new features.

## What is new?
- I added a 'highlight' and 'done' functionality so that the user can mark important and finished tasks.
- Also added a task filter so that once a task has been marked as important or done, the user could select which group to view.
- Finally the app saves the tasks to the local storage so that tasks can remain for the user to revisit them.

## What is next?
Yes I know that to-do list is kind of a basic and boring project, but I believe that practice makes perfect and it's a cool way to keep learning new things while developing other projects. 

So the next step will be adding drag and drop functionality to the tasks so that users can visually drop them into separate buckets.
